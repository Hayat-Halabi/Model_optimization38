# Scenario:
Imagine you are a machine learning engineer tasked with comparing the performance of two optimization algorithms, Adagrad and SGD, for training a neural network to classify images of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. You need to implement the training process, record relevant metrics, and draw conclusions based on your findings.

# Problem Statement:
Train a neural network to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. Compare the performance of two optimization algorithms, Adagrad and SGD, in terms of training speed and final accuracy.

# Direction
Loading and Preparing MNIST Dataset with TensorFlow

Import the TensorFlow library along with the necessary modules.

Load the MNIST dataset and partition it into training and testing sets. Normalize pixel values to fall within the range of [0, 1] by dividing by 255.

Creating a Neural Network for MNIST Digit Classification with TensorFlow

Create a Sequential model comprising a Flatten layer to preprocess the input, followed by a Dense hidden layer activated by ReLU, and a final Dense output layer with softmax activation.
Training MNIST Digit Classifier with Adagrad Optimizer

Compile the model utilizing the Adagrad optimizer, with a learning rate set at 0.01. Specify the loss function as sparse_categorical_crossentropy, and include accuracy as a metric to monitor during training.

Train the model using the training images and labels for a total of 10 epochs. Keep track of validation data to assess model performance.

Training MNIST Classifier with SGD Optimizer

Establish a new model by duplicating the original one. Compile this new model using the SGD optimizer, with a learning rate set at 0.01.

Train the new model using the training images and labels for 10 epochs, mirroring the process used for the Adagrad model.

Optimizer Comparison: Adagrad vs. SGD

Define a function named plot_history to graphically represent the training history, encompassing accuracy and loss, for a given model.

Utilize the plot_history function to visually compare the training history (accuracy and loss) for both the Adagrad and SGD models.

Evaluate the ultimate models on the test data and record the test loss and accuracy for both Adagrad and SGD.

### Display the final test accuracy for both the Adagrad and SGD models.

### Load and Prepare MNIST Dataset with TensorFlow
### Import the TensorFlow library and necessary modules.
### Import necessary components from the TensorFlow.keras module.
### Import the MNIST dataset from the TensorFlow.keras.datasets module.
